Project Name: 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

Tasks

0. Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98 using void reset_to_98(int *n) as the Prototype.
1. Write a function that swaps the values of two integers. Use Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
2. Write a function that returns the length of a string. Use Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);
3. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. Use Prototype: void _puts(char *str);
4. Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. Use Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);
5. Write a function that reverses a string. Use Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);
6. Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. Use Prototype: void puts2(char *str);
7. Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. Use Prototype: void puts_half(char *str); The function is required to print the second half of the string. If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2.
8. Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. Use Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
9. Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest. Use Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
